* Most of this is a balancing act
* Affects the persona

base_value:
	mpcp		: 5	: total number of all upgrades allowed (constant)
	hardening	: 5	: defense of persona (percent taken from ICE damage)

hardware_value:
	response	: -	: not used
	memory		: 5	: size of programs allowed (multiplier from base value)
	storage		: 10	: # of programs allowed (constant)
	io_speed	: 3	: # steps to un/install program (base 90 - io_speed * 10)

* Can ignore these for now...used for "attacking"
