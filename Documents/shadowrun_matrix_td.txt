	Defense
		Defend your cyberdeck

Character Stats:
	Negotation
	Computer
	Combat


Cyberdeck
	Protect from IC, Multiple, Upgradable
	Stats: Base Values, Hardware, Attributes
		Base Values: MPCP (max upgrade lvl), Hardening (defense)
		Hardware: Response (deck speed), Memory (program load, max 5), Storage (programs equipped, datafiles), Load/IO Speed (program speed)
		Attributes: Bod (armor), Evasion (evade, accuracy), Masking (node detection, Deception success), Sensor (Analyze success)
	

Upgrade Tips: 
	Attribute to upgrade...Masking
	Hardware to upgrade...Response
		Load/IO Speed not important if you don't need to change programs often if have enough space.
		Storage and Memory important to get better/more programs.
	When buying programs...leave room for data.

	Attack: (S) crash IC, needed when masking fails
	Slow: (L) reduces IC reactions (Trace IC immune)
	Degrade: (L-Sp) lowers node security rating, defenses weakened
	Rebound: (M-Sp) returns attacks to attacker, weakens with each attack
	Medic: (L) repairs damage to deck
	Shield: (L) reduces damage from attacks, degrades with each attack, (Black IC immune)
	Smoke: (S) electronic chaos, ALL actions have added difficulty, degrades every 4 seconds
	Mirrors: (M) decreases attack accuracy, degrades every 4 seconds
	Sleaze: (M) bypass node completely
	Deception: (S) creates passcodes to fool Access & Gray IC, (Barrier & Black IC immune), doesn't work in combat
	Relocate: (S) distracts Trace IC, works in combat
	Analyze: (M) scans node and IC for information, health & successfulness
